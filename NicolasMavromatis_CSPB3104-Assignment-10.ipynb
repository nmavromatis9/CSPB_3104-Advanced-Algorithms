    "\n",
    "An arbitrage in finance is a way to make money for sure without much risk. For instance, suppose 1 USD yields 5 Chinese RMB and 1 RMB trades for 0.4 Euros, and 1 Euro trades for 0.52 USD,  you have an arbitrage opportunity\n",
    "wherein you can take x USD, obtain 5x RMB, and in turn trade them for 2x Euros and finally end up with 1.02x USD back. Every time you exercise this opportunity, you get a 2 cent profit (assuming you can trade for free and there is no spread in the buying and selling prices, but that is another can of worms).\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, arbitrage cannot exist in efficient markets but they can persist for a short amount of time. Electronic traders can then search for such opportunities in real time and rapidly exploit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a basket of $n$ currencies and for each pair of currencies $(C_i,C_j)$, you are given a ratio\n",
    "$R_{i,j}$ that says that one unit of currency $C_i$ is currently fetching $R_{i,j}$ units of $C_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__(A)__ Given the ratios $R_{i,j}$ write an efficient algorithm that can detect if any arbitrage opportunities currently exist. What is the running time of your algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "(__Hint:__ Make a graph out of the problem data. What does the presence of arbitrage mean for this graph? )\n",
    "\n",
    "__(B)__ We are not just interested in finding an arbitrage opportunity, but also interested in finding the shortest length opportunity, defined as one that involves the smallest number of trades. Naturally, given that prices change\n",
    "and also given that there are trading fees, such opportunities are more desirable. \n",

    "First, build a directed graph where each node represents a currency type. A directed edge from node $C_i$ to $C_j$ means that currency $C_i$ can be exchanged for currency $C_j$ by an exchange rate of the weighted edge $R_{i,j}$. An edge should also be built from $C_j$ to $C_i$ with an edge weight of $1/R_{i,j}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The arbitage problem is about finding the maximum amount of currency that can be gained through exchanges, but shortest path algorithms find the shortest path. Thus, we need to modify our graph slightly. Exchange rates are multiplicative, so first make the edge weights the log of the original edge weights.  Next, negate all the edge weights, and build the graph as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitage opportunity can then be represented by a cycle between nodes, with an overall negative weight, representing a gain in currency through trading (and a positive cycle in the original problem). To find the a cycle/arbitage opportunity, run the standard Floyd Warshall algorithm on the negated graph, to find shortest path distances in a 2d matrix. If any currencies have a path that connects the node to itself (in a loop), this means that an arbitage opportunity involving that currency exists. This will appear as a negative value in the matrix on the diagonal, where a node has a cycle to itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is this: A negative-weight cycle on the negative-log graph represents an arbitrage opportunity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Floyd-Warshall's complexity is $\\Theta(V^3)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "__(B)__\n",
    "We are tasked with finding the shortest cycle in the original graph from 1A). To do this, we can use a slightly modified Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Set the $distance[u][V]$ to be infinity, as normal. That is, the distance from a given node, u to any other vertex is initialized to infinity. The modified part is that $distance[u][u]$   is initialized to infinity, instead of 0. The algorithm will then work to find the shortest distance from a given node, u, to itself in a cycle. Finally, we find the minimum of all values of $distance[u][u]$  , where u is any vertex that connects to itself in a loop. This minimum value will be the smallest length arbitage opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stated another way, to detect negative cycles after running FW, look at the diagonal values of the 2d matrix, where $i==j$. A negative diagonal value (in the negative-log graph) means there is a negative loop from the vertex to itself. Find the minimum of all such values to find the smallest length arbitrage opportunity.\n",
