    " * The number of matches in round 3= n/8...\n",

    "4. In the worst case, the number of matches played by the winner is the total number of rounds (z), where the ultimate winner plays in each round. </br>\n",

    "\n",
    "5. The winner of the tournament will always be the player with the maximum hidden talent score, because this player will never lose to anyone.</br>\n",
    "However, the runner up (second place) player may not be the one with second highest hidden talent score. </br>\n",
    "This is due to the fact that if there is an odd number of players starting and finishing a round, then a randomly selected player advances to the next round. </br>\n",
    "In this case, a low hidden score player may advance to the final round and lose to the player with the highest hidden score, thus becoming the runner up. </br>\n",

    "To identify the player with the second highest talent score, we need to hold a loser tournament after the normal tournament in which only the losers play. </br>\n",

    "This would eventually select the player with the second highest talent score as the ultimate winner of the loser rounds. </br>\n",
