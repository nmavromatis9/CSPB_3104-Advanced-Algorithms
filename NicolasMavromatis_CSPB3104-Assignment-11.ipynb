    "First, we must show that the $k$-independent set problem is in NP. This means it must have a polynomial time verifiable certificate that verifies a given solution.  \n",
    "This can be done by verifying that for the K vertices, for each pair there is no edge between them, which can be verified in $\\Theta(N^2)$ time using an adjacency list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next requirement to show a problem is NPC is to prove that all other NP problems are polynomial reducible to that problem. It is proven that the $3$-CNF-SAT and K-Clique problem are NPC, so that any problem that is reducible to one of these two NPC problems must be NPC itself by transitivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A) We now must reduce the $3$-CNF-SAT problem to the $k$-independent set (KIS) problem in polynomial time.  \n",
    "In the $3$-CNF-SAT problem, let $k$ be the number of clauses. Create a graph with $k$ clusters of vertices, where each vertex represents and is labelled with one of the literals of a clause. Each vertex within each cluster should be connected to the other two vertices in a cluster. A vertex has an edge to another vertex in a different cluster iff the second vertex is the first's negation (that is $L$ and $¬L$).  \n",

    "independent set of size $K$, with one vertex from each clause. The reverse is also true: If the graph has an independent set of size $K$ then the $K$ clause CNF was satisfiable. The conversion can be done in polynomial time, and the $3$-CNF-SAT problem is reducable to the KIS problem, proving KIS is NPC. \n",

    "B) We now must reduce the K-Clique problem to the KIS problem in polynomial time.  \n",
    "First, make a compliment of the original graph, $G'$, so that $G'$ has an edge between vertices iff the edge did not exist in the original graph, $G$. This complement graph can be built in polynomial time and represents the problem conversion step.    \n",
    "If there is a clique of size $K$ in the original graph, $G$, it means that all vertices in the clique share an edge with all others in the clique, which means that no pair of these vertices have an edge between them in $G'$, which is the same as an independent set. This means if there is a clique of size $K$ in $G$ then there is an indpendent set of size $K$ in $G'$. The reverse is also true, that if $G'$ has an independent set of size $K$, then the original graph has a clique of size $K$. This proves that the KC problem can be polynomially reduced to the KIS problem, so the KIS problem is NPC.  \n",
